## Bioinformatic steps in RNA sequencing (Tutorial)

Quantifying gene expression and identifying transcripts that are differentially expressed between two set of samples is an important approach in modern biotechnology. RNA-seq analysis based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is the gold standard for the analysis of gene expression at the level of the whole transcriptome.  RNA-seq involves isolation of total RNA from tissues or cells of interest followed by the construction of DNA libraries and sequencing of these libraries using a next-generation sequencing instrument (Fig 1).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shijusisobhan/Bioinformatic-RNAseq/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
